Real-Time Conversational AI with Talking Avatar using Groq, Tavus API, and Gradio

A lifelike AI chatbot system that processes user messages, generates intelligent responses using the Groq large language model, and produces synchronized talking-avatar video replies using the Tavus API — providing an immersive and realistic conversational experience.

## About
This project introduces a **next-generation conversational AI system** that integrates natural language processing with **video-based avatar generation**. Unlike traditional chatbots that only reply with text, this system uses the **GroqModel API** to generate context-aware responses and the **Tavus API** to convert those responses into a video where an AI avatar speaks with realistic expressions, lip-sync, and tone.

The main goal of this project is to enhance the user experience through **visual human-like interaction**, which can be deployed in sectors such as:
- EdTech
- Customer support
- Virtual assistance
- Psychology / counseling
- Retail AI agents
- Interactive training & onboarding platforms

## Features
- Real-time conversational response powered by Groq LLM.
- Generates lifelike talking-avatar videos using Tavus.
- Adjustable conversation tone (Friendly, Formal, Professional, etc.).
- Simple web-based UI built using Gradio.
- Public sharable link for deployment.
- Highly scalable and modular client-based architecture.
- Automatic streaming of video once generated.

## Requirements
* **Operating System**: 64-bit Windows 10/11 / Ubuntu / macOS.
* **Programming Language**: Python 3.10 or later.
* **APIs Required**:
  - Groq API Key for text generation
  - Tavus API Key + Replica ID for video rendering
* **Libraries / Dependencies**:
  - Gradio – user interface
  - Requests – REST API communication
  - Python-dotenv – environment variable management
  - Swarmauri / GroqModel – LLM backend
* **IDE**: VS Code recommended.
* **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for collaboration and deployment.

## Results and Impact
The Talking Avatar AI system transforms the way users interact with chatbots by offering **human-like video responses**, creating a more engaging, personalized, and immersive experience. This technology has strong application potential in customer support, training, education, corporate presentations, healthcare, and marketing.

By integrating LLMs with avatar-based video synthesis, this project demonstrates how conversational AI can move beyond plain text to **emotional and expressive communication**, paving the way for next-generation virtual assistants.
